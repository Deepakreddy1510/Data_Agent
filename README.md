# Data Agent

An multi-agent system for working with structured data using natural language.

The project uses **LangGraph, LangChain, Groq, GPT-OSS, PostgreSQL, and Pandas** to route user requests to specialized agents for SQL analysis or ETL operations.

## Overview

Data Agent allows users to interact with databases and data-processing workflows using natural-language instructions.

For example, a user can ask:

```text
What are the different payment methods available in the database?
```

or:

```text
Extract data from https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon
and save it in the data/extract folder as CSV.
```

The main Data Agent analyzes the request and routes it to one of two specialized agents:

* SQL Analyst Agent
* ETL Analyst Agent

This project demonstrates concepts such as:

* Agentic AI
* Multi-agent workflows
* LangGraph orchestration
* LLM tool calling
* Natural language to SQL
* SQL safety validation
* API data extraction
* Data transformation using Pandas
* Structured outputs using Pydantic
* PostgreSQL integration

## Architecture

The system follows a router-based multi-agent architecture.

                |
                v

```

The workflow is:

```text
User Input
    |
    v
Data Agent Router
    |
    +---- SQL Request ----> SQL Analyst Agent
    |
    +---- ETL Request ----> ETL Analyst Agent
```

## Features

### Intelligent Query Routing

The Data Agent automatically identifies whether the user's request is related to:

```text
sql
```

or:

```text
etl
```

The router uses structured LLM output validated using Pydantic.

### SQL Analyst Agent

The SQL Analyst Agent converts natural-language questions into PostgreSQL queries.

Its workflow includes:

1. Curating the user's question
2. Retrieving database schema information
3. Building database context for the LLM
4. Generating a SQL query
5. Validating SQL safety
6. Executing safe queries
7. Converting the result into a user-friendly response

Example:

```text
What are the different types of payment methods in the database?
```

The agent can generate the appropriate SQL query, validate it, execute it, and return the results.

### SQL Safety Validation

Before executing a generated query, the SQL Agent checks whether the query is safe.

The safety layer is designed to prevent destructive operations such as:

```sql
INSERT
UPDATE
DELETE
DROP
ALTER
TRUNCATE
```

The intended workflow allows read-oriented SQL queries to continue while unsafe queries are rejected.

### ETL Analyst Agent

The ETL Analyst Agent handles extraction and transformation tasks.

It currently provides tools for:

* Extracting data from APIs
* Saving extracted data locally
* Reading dataset context
* Generating Pandas transformation code
* Executing generated transformations
* Saving transformed results

### API Data Extraction

Example request:

```text
Extract data from the API endpoint
https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon
and save it to data/extract in CSV format.
```

The ETL Agent selects the extraction tool and saves the result as:

```text
data/extract/extracted_data.csv
```

### Data Transformation

The ETL Agent can also transform existing data.

Example:

```text
Transform the extracted Pokemon data and keep only
the row containing bulbasaur.
```

The agent provides the data context to the LLM, generates Pandas code based on the request, and executes the transformation.

## LLM Configuration

The project currently uses **Groq** as the LLM provider.

The models are selected according to task complexity.

| Level  | Model                 |
| ------ | --------------------- |
| Low    | `openai/gpt-oss-20b`  |
| Medium | `openai/gpt-oss-120b` |
| High   | `openai/gpt-oss-120b` |

The model selection logic is implemented in:

```text
utils/llm_pick.py
```

This allows different models to be selected without changing the logic inside individual agents.

## Tech Stack

The main technologies used in this project are:

* Python
* LangChain
* LangGraph
* Groq
* GPT-OSS
* PostgreSQL
* Psycopg2
* Pandas
* Pydantic
* Requests
* python-dotenv

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have:

* Python 3.14+
* PostgreSQL
* Git
* Groq API key

Using a virtual environment is recommended.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Deepakreddy1510/AI_Data_Agent.git
cd AI_Data_Agent
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment

Windows:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

macOS/Linux:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

Using `uv`:

```bash
uv sync
```

or:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root.

Example:

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key

host=localhost
port=5432
user=postgres
password=your_postgres_password
database=your_database_name
```

Do not commit your `.env` file or API keys to GitHub.

## PostgreSQL Setup

The SQL Analyst requires access to a PostgreSQL database.

The application reads database configuration from the following environment variables:

```text
host
port
user
password
database
```

The project also contains:

```text
utils/feed_db.py
```

which is used for setting up and populating the sample database used during development.

## Running the Project

Run the main Data Agent using:

```bash
python main.py
```

Example:

```python
from agents.data_agent import data_agent
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage

response = data_agent.invoke(
    {
        "messages": [
            HumanMessage(
                content="""
                Extract the data from the API endpoint
                'https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon'
                and save it to data/extract in CSV format.
                """
            )
        ],
        "route_response": ""
    }
)

print(response)
```

## Example Queries

### API Extraction

```text
Extract data from the API endpoint
https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon
and save it to data/extract in CSV format.
```

Expected route:

```text
etl
```

The ETL Agent extracts the data and saves it locally.

### Data Transformation

```text
Transform the data stored in extracted_data.csv
and keep only the row for bulbasaur.

Save the transformed data in data/transform.
```

The ETL Agent generates and executes the required Pandas transformation.

### Database Query

```text
What are the different types of payment methods
available in the database?
```

Expected route:

```text
sql
```

The SQL Analyst then performs the following workflow:

```text
Question
   |
   v
Question Curation
   |
   v
Database Schema
   |
   v
SQL Generation
   |
   v
Safety Validation
   |
   v
SQL Execution
   |
   v
Final Answer
```

## LangGraph Workflows

The repository contains generated workflow diagrams:

```text
data_agent_graph.png
etl_analyst_graph.png
sql_analyst_graph.png
```

These diagrams show how the nodes and conditional edges are connected inside each LangGraph workflow.

## State Management

The project uses Pydantic models to represent the state passed between LangGraph nodes.

For example, the main Data Agent state contains:

```python
class DataAgentSchema(BaseModel):
    messages: Annotated[list, add]
    route_response: str
```

The message state is used to maintain the agent conversation while the router decision determines which specialized agent should handle the request.

## Security Considerations

The SQL agent only allows read-only queries. Requests such as `DELETE`, `UPDATE`, `DROP`, and other database-changing operations are blocked before execution.

The ETL agent can generate and execute Pandas code for transformations. Since this code is generated dynamically, this part needs more protection before the project is used in a production environment.

Some security improvements that can be added later are:

- Run generated ETL code in a restricted environment
- Add query timeouts
- Limit which files the ETL agent can access
- Protect database credentials and API keys
- Add logs for SQL execution, safety checks, ETL operations, and errors

## Future Improvements

I plan to improve the project step by step as I continue working on it.

- Deploy the Streamlit frontend and FastAPI backend
- Add file download support for ETL outputs
- Improve SQL safety checks
- Add better error handling and retries
- Improve support for follow-up questions
- Add more tests for SQL and ETL flows
- Support more file types such as Excel and Parquet
- Improve support for raw, staging, fact, and dimension tables
- Add logging and monitoring
- Improve security for database connections and generated code
- Add Docker support
- Support more LLM providers in the future
